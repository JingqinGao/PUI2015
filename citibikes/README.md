##This is a group work by Jingqin Gao & Fernando Zingler

###You will need to download 2015 April and August data of NYC Citibikes from citibike webpage to run the code: 
https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

The idea of testing peak hour/off-peak hour trips by subscriber/non-subscriber came out after a brainstorm between us.

We assume a typical time range for commercial hours, peak hours, and off-peak hours.

###Contributions:
Jingqin Gao: 

Determined the idea + testable hypothesis

Set up the code for April data. 

Fine-tune the figures. (e.g. how to do multiple plots with the same axis range, different legend locations, titles)

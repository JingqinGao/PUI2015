###Assignment 1:
Generate 100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000) from each of 6 different distributions

File name: HW3_assignment1.ipynb

1. Chi-square Distribution
2. Normal Distribution
3. Poisson Distribution
4. Binomial Distribution
5. Triangular Distribution
6. Exponential Distribution

Global setting:
Population Mean = 100
Random Seed = 1111

The plots of sample means tells us that in the limit of sample size N ->infinity，the sample mean approaches a Gaussian distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ, regardless of the distribution of X.

###Assignment 2:
Fill in the cells in the ipython notebook to test effectivenes of NYC Post-Prison Employment Programs
